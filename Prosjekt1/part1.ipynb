The natural length of the spring is the length of the spring when it is neither compressed nor expanded. It should not be difficult to see from the diagram below that\n",

Because the size (absolute value) of the spring force increases when $x$ goes further away from $x_{eq}$, the spring force eventually becomes stronger than gravity, thus pulling the box back up. This is illustrated in the diagram using the length of the force arrows (vectors): the length of the $S$ arrow is greater than the length of the $G$ arrow, which means the net force $\\sum F=G+S$ is pointing upwards."

Recall this spring does not experience gravity, meaning it might as well be floating in dead space, but it's still swinging back and forth!

Regardless of whether gravity is pulling it down or not, the spring force will always try to pull the box towards the equilibrium position. **Hence, for all springs, it's not gravity that makes it start to fall down at** `t=0`.
